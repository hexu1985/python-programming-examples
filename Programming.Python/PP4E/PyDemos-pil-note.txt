PyPhoto requires the PIL open source Python imaging library 
to be installed separately, for image thumbnail generation, 
and for viewing of some photo types.  See the book for details,
and search on google to fetch and download PIL for Python 3.X.
A prerelease 3.X version of PIL is in the book examples tree.

Also note that images in this distribution and its saved mail
files were reduced in size and resolution to save space.  Use
images of your own to experiment further.
