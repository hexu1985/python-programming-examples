Lately though, what’s been really fun to see is those out-of-the-box and creative papers! With this fairly recent rush of 
deep learning in computer vision, we’re still discovering all the possibilities. Many papers will present totally 
new applications of deep networks in vision. They may not be the most fundamentally ground-breaking works, but they’re fun 
to see and offer a creative and enlightening perspective to the field, often sparking new ideas from the new angle they present. 
All in all, they’re pretty cool!
