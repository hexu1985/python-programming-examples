# Computer's user interface is the part of the computer which the user interacts with.

# 2
# Command line interface works by displaying a prompt, then the user enters 
# a command that will be executed.

# 3
# In a text-based environment programs determine the order in which things happen.

# 4
# Event-driven program is a program that respondes to events to execute a program 
# events such as clicking of a button . . . 

# 5
# a) Label: Is an area that displays one line of text or an image.
# b) Entry: Is an area where the user may type a single line of input form keyboard.
# c) Button: It can cause an action to occur when it is clicked.
# d) Frame: Is a container that can hold other widgets.

# 6
# We can create root widget by creating an instance of the tkinter's Tk class.

# 7
# tkinter's mainloop function runs an infinte loop until you close the function.

# 8
# The widget's pack determines where the widget should be displayed and makes 
# the widget visible with the main window.

# 9
# If the two label widgets are called with no arguments the two widget's will be
# displayed stacked on top of another.

# 10
# To place the widget at the left part of the main widget, we pass the side = 'left'
# argument into to the pack method

# 11
# You can retrieve data from Entry widget you must use entry widget's Entry method.

# 12
# The data that is retrieved from the Entry widget is string type.

# 13
# The tkinter module is where StringVar exists in.

# 14
# By associating a StringVar object with a label widget we can dynamically display our data.

# 15
# To select only one item from a group of items I would use the radio buttons because they are mutually exclusive. 

# 16
# If I wanted for a user to be able to select any number of choice from group of items I will use the check buttons.

# 17
# When creating radio buttons one to be selected from others you must associate all the related radio buttons with 
# one IntVar object. but they must be assigned a unique value, so when one of the buttons are selected
# the IntVAr object will be assigned the choice's unique integer.

# 18
# When creating checkbuttons you will associate each button with a different object of the IntVar class
# and when the desired buttons is called its instance will have the value of 1 and other instances will have
# value of 0.

# 19
# In the canvas the left upper pixel have coordinates of (0,0)

# 20
# For canvas 640 pixel wide and 480 pixel high the coordinates of the lower right corner will have coordinates (639, 479)

# 21
# In the cartesian coordinate system the y axis inceases when we are ascending up while in the canvas coordinate system
# y axis increases when we descend down and in cartesian coordinate system (0,0) is located at the center. 

# 22
# a) create_oval
# b) create_rectangle
# c) create_rectangle
# d) create_polygon
# e) create_ovel
# f) create_arc
