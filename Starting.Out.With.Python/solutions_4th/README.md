# Starting out with Python - 4<sup>th</sup> edition (SOLUTIONS)

This repository contains solutions to the problems in the book **Starting Out with Python by Tony Gaddis**. Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development, scientific computing, data analysis, artificial intelligence, and more. The book is designed for beginners who have no prior programming experience and covers the basics of Python programming, including data types, control structures, functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, file input/output, and more.

## Table of Contents

The repository is organized into 13 folders, each containing the solutions for a specific chapter of the book. The solutions are written in Python 3 and tested using the VSCode IDE.

### Final word of advice
- ####  *Don't look at the solutions until you've tried your best to answer the question yourself.*
- This is a simple but effective way to remind yourself to think critically and try to solve the problem on your own. It's also a good way to build your problem-solving skills and confidence.solutions may not be the same as mine but as long as they serve the functionality it is okay.
