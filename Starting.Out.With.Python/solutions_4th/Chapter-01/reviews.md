## Answer to Short answer questions

`1. How does the main memory and the secondary storage of a computer differ from each
other?`

> Main memory, also known as RAM, is used for storing data temporarily while it is being executed by CPU. It is volatile, meaning it loses all its data when the computer is turned off. On the other hand, secondary storage, such as hard disk drives and solid-state drives, is used to store data for long periods of time even when the power is turned off.

`2. What number does a bit that is turned on represent? What number does a bit that is
turned off represent?`

> A bit is a binary digit (0 or 1). 0 represents a bit that is turned off, while 1 represents a bit that is turned on.

`3. How many different characters can be represented in ASCII? Name the character set
that addresses this limitation.`

> ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) can represent 128 different characters, including letters, numbers, and symbols. The character set that addresses this limitation is called Extended ASCII, which can represent up to 256 characters.

`4. What is an individual instruction in a program written in a high-level programming
language called?`

> An individual instruction in a program written in a high-level programming language is called a statement. Statements are used to perform specific actions or operations in a program.

`5. What are the short words that are used in assembly language called?`

> The short words that are used in assembly language to give instructions are called mnemonics. Mnemonics are used to represent machine language instructions in a more human-readable format.

`6. What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?`

> A compiler and an interpreter are both used to translate high-level programming languages into machine code that can be executed by a computer. However, a compiler translates the entire program into machine code before it is executed, while an interpreter translates the program line by line as it is executed.

`7. What type of software controls the internal operations of the computerâ€™s hardware?`

> System software is a type of software that controls the internal operations of a computer. It includes the operating system, device drivers, and utility programs that manage and maintain the computer's hardware and software resources.
