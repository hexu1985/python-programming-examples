# Answer to Checkpoints Chapter - 01

  `1.1 What is a program?`

> A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform a specific task. It is a sequence of instructions that are executed by the computer to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem.

`1.2		What is hardware?`

> Hardware refers to the physical components that make up a computer system. It includes all the tangible components of a computer system such as the monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, motherboard, CPU, hard disk, and other peripheral devices.

` 1.3	 List the five major components of a computer system.`

> The five major components of a computer system are Input devices, Output devices, Secondary storage devices, Main Memory, and CPU. Input devices are used to input data into the computer, output devices are used to display or output data from the computer, secondary storage devices are used to store data for long periods of time, main memory is used to store data and programs temporarily while the computer is running, and the CPU is responsible for executing instructions and controlling the operation of the computer.

` 1.4		 What part of the computer actually runs programs?`

> The Central Processing Unit (CPU) is the part of the computer that actually runs programs. It is responsible for executing instructions and controlling the operation of the computer.

` 1.5		 What part of the computer serves as a work area to store a program and its data while the program is running?`

> The Random Access Memory (RAM) serves as a work area to store a program and its data while the program is running. It is a volatile memory that is used to store data and programs temporarily while the computer is running. When the computer is turned off, the data stored in RAM is lost.

` 1.6		 What part of the computer holds data for long periods of time, even when there is no power to the computer?`

> Secondary storage devices are used to hold data for a long periods of time. Examples of secondary storage devices include hard disk drives, solid-state drives, USB flash drives, and memory cards.

` 1.7		 What part of the computer collects data from people and from other devices?`

> Input devices collect data from people and from other devices. Examples of input devices include keyboard, mouse, microphone, scanner, and camera.

` 1.8		 What part of the computer formats and presents data for people or other devices?`

> Output devices format and present data for people or other devices. Examples of output devices include monitor, printer, speaker, and projector.

` 1.9		 What fundamental set of programs control the internal operations of the computer’s hardware?`

> Operating systems are a fundamental set of programs that control the internal operations of the computer's hardware. Examples of operating systems include Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android.

` 1.10		What do you call a program that performs a specialized task, such as a virus scanner, a file compression program, or a data backup program?`

> A program that performs a specialized task is called a utility program. Examples of utility programs include antivirus software, file compression software, and backup software.

`1.11		Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers, and game programs belong to what category of software?`

> Word processing programs, spreadsheet programs, email programs, web browsers, and game programs belong to the category of application software. Application software is designed to perform specific tasks for the user.

`1.12 		What amount of memory is enough to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number?`

> One byte of memory is enough to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number. A byte is a unit of digital information that consists of 8 bits.

`1.13 		What do you call a tiny “switch” that can be set to either on or off?`

> A tiny "switch" that can be set to either on or off is called a bit (short for binary digit). A bit is the smallest unit of digital information.

`1.14 		In what numbering system are all numeric values written as sequences of 0s and 1s?`

> All numeric values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s in the binary numbering system. The binary numbering system is used by computers to represent and manipulate digital information.

`1.15 		What is the purpose of ASCII?`

> ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard that is used to represent text in computers and other devices. It is used to represent English letters, various punctuation marks, numeric codes, and other characters.

`1.16 		What encoding scheme is extensive enough to represent the characters of many of the languages in the world?`

> Unicode is an encoding scheme that is extensive enough to represent the characters of many of the languages in the world. It is a universal character encoding standard that is used to represent text in computers and other devices.

`1.17 		What do the terms “digital data” and “digital device” mean?`

> Digital data refers to data that is stored in binary form (0s and 1s) and can be processed by computers and other digital devices. A digital device is any device that works with binary data, such as computers, smartphones, digital cameras, and digital watches.

`1.18 		A CPU understands instructions that are written only in what language?`

> A CPU (Central Processing Unit) understands instructions that are written only in machine language. Machine language is a low-level programming language that consists of binary code (0s and 1s) that can be executed directly by the CPU.

`1.19 		A program has to be copied into what type of memory each time the CPU executes it?`

> A program has to be copied into RAM (Random Access Memory) each time the CPU executes it. RAM is a type of volatile memory that is used to store data and programs temporarily while the computer is running.

`1.20 		When a CPU executes the instructions in a program, it is engaged in what process?`

> When a CPU executes the instructions in a program, it is engaged in the fetch-decode-execute cycle. This cycle consists of three steps: fetching the next instruction from memory, decoding the instruction to determine what operation to perform, and executing the operation.

`1.21 		What is assembly language?`

> Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses short words (mnemonics) to represent machine language instructions. Assembly language is easier to read and write than machine language, but it still requires a deep understanding of the computer's hardware architecture.

`1.22 		What type of programming language allows you to create powerful and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works?`

> A high-level programming language allows you to create powerful and complex programs without knowing how the CPU works. High-level languages are designed to be easy to read and write, and they use natural language constructs to make programming more intuitive.

`1.23 		Each language has a set of rules that must be strictly followed when writing a program. What is this set of rules called?`

> The set of rules that must be strictly followed when writing a program is called syntax. Syntax defines the structure and format of the language, including rules for punctuation, keywords, and other elements of the language.

`1.24 		What do you call a program that translates a high-level language program into a separate machine language program?`

> A program that translates a high-level language program into a separate machine language program is called a compiler. Compilers are used to convert source code written in a high-level language into machine code that can be executed directly by the CPU.

`1.25 		What do you call a program that both translates and executes the instructions in a high-level language program?`

> A program that both translates and executes the instructions in a high-level language program is called an interpreter. Interpreters are used to convert source code written in a high-level language into machine code on-the-fly, as the program is being executed.

`1.26 		What type of mistake is usually caused by a misspelled key word, a missing punctuation character, or the incorrect use of an operator?`

> A syntax error is usually caused by a misspelled keyword, a missing punctuation character, or the incorrect use of an operator. Syntax errors occur when the code violates the rules of the language's syntax, and they prevent the code from being compiled or executed.

### TIP: Source code is statements programmer writes in a high level language.
