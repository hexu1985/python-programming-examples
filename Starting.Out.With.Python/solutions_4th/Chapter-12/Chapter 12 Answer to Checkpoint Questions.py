# 1
# overhead actions are actions like allocating memory for local for paramters and local variables.
# that happen when a function is called  so when we say recursive algorithms has more overhead than iterative
#  algorithms it is to mean recursive algorithms do more work than iterative algorthims when solving a problem.

# 2
# A case where a problem can be solved without recursion is known as a base case.

# 3
# A case where a problem is solved using recursion is known as recursive case.

# 4
# Reaching the base case is what will eventually cause recursive algorithm to stop calling itself.

# 5
# Direct recursion is a type of recursion where a function only calls itself.
# Indirect recursion is a recursion that more than one functions call each other.
