# Software requirement is the specific purpose(single task) the program is

# Algorithm is set of well-defined legal steps that is taken to perform a specific task.

# Pseudocode is an informal language, with no syntax rules that tries to mimic
# the actual program to be written in a way that human being understands.

# Flowchart is a diagram that depicts steps that take place in program.

# No, python is made to be case-sensitive, so it treats values with capital and small letters as different.

# 13 
# It is invalid because the variable must be on the left side of the "=" operator
# to give value of the data on the right, and since python will see it as 
# a variable and return  an error
