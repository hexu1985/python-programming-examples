# To gain an understanding of a problem a programmer must understand what a program
# is supposed to do, usually by interviewing the customer.

# 2
# Pseudocode is written in words that doesn't concern the syntax and are not
# meant to be compiled or executed.

# 3
# Computer program typically perform input receiving, data processing, and displaying output.

# 4
# There are five rules to be considered when naming a variable.
# i, Don't use python's keywords as variable.
# ii, Variable's name can not have spaces within them.
# iii, First character must be small or capital letters and underscore.
# iv, Uppercase and Lowercase are distinct.
# v, You can use numbers after starting with letter and an underscore.

# 5
# Floating point division gives result as floating point number.(in decimals)
# while integer division gives the result as an integer(in whole numbers)

# 6
# Magic number is a number that is unexplained in a programmers code.
# they are problematic because their purpose is not specified, and are
# very hard to correct if a mistake is found.

# TIP -> the input function always receives and stores data as a string.
age_number = input('Please enter your age here : ')  # Receives age of the user
age = int(age_number)                               # Changing the data type into integer(int)

color = input('Please enter the name of your favourite color here: ')

# a -> b = a+2
# b -> a = b*4
# c -> b = a/3.14
# d -> a = b-8

# a -> x+y = 4+8 = 12
# b -> z*2 = 2*2 = 4
# c -> y/x = 8/4 = 2.0
# d -> y-z = 8-2 = 6

due = total - down_payment

# 7 
total = subtotal * 0.15

# 8
# according to precedence of the operations b*c will be executed first, and it's result
# 6 will be added to 5 to give the result "11"

# 9
# In the second line of code num will have a new value of 5 so the code will display 
# the number "5"

# 10
sales = 342.398       # This is a sample value for sales
